# Agent Rules

## Pull Request Rule
- Always create a dedicated new branch before creating a pull request.
- Do not create pull requests from a reused existing branch.
- After creating or editing a pull request, verify the description formatting.
- Do not pass escaped newline sequences like `\n` in PR bodies.
- Use real line breaks (for example with `gh pr create --body-file`), then check the rendered markdown.
