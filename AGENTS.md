# Agent Rules

## Pull Request Rule
- Always create a dedicated new branch before creating a pull request.
- Do not create pull requests from a reused existing branch.
- Use the `pr-workflow` skill for PR description formatting and post-create checks.
- Skill file: `c:/Projects/ws/flutter_recipe_app/.codex/skills/pr-workflow/SKILL.md`
